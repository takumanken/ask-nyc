────────────────────────────
II. MEASURE LIST

• count(1)                 : Alias num_of_requests — Number of SRs.
• avg(time_to_resolve_sec) : Alias avg_sec_to_resolve — Average resolution time in seconds.

────────────────────────────
III. COMPLAINT TYPE HIERARCHY

For complaint-related queries, **complaint_category is the PRIMARY FIELD**.
Only use complaint_type or complaint_descriptor for more granular detail when explicitly requested.

1. Complaint Category (Broad)
   - Aggregates detailed complaint types into high-level categories.
   - You can refer to "ADDITIONAL COMPLAINT FILTER VALUES" section for filtering.

2. Complaint Type (Moderate Detail)
   - Represents the original detailed complaint value.
   - Use only when higher resolution is explicitly requested.
   - You can refer to "ADDITIONAL COMPLAINT FILTER VALUES" section for filtering.

3. Complaint Descriptor (Finer Detail)
   - Contains additional fine-grained details.
   - Use only if the user explicitly requests the most detailed information.

────────────────────────────
IV. DEFINITIONS FOR SQL GENERATION

1. Dimension:
   - A column or an expression used for grouping.
   - Use the DuckDB SQL dialect and provide an alias when required.
   - Return an empty list if no dimension exists.

4. Measure:
   - A column or an expression used for aggregate calculations.
   - Use the DuckDB SQL dialect and provide an alias when required.
   - Return an empty list if no measure exists.

5. Pre-Aggregation Filter:
   - A filter applied before performing any aggregation (comparable to a WHERE clause).
   - Use valid DuckDB SQL syntax.
   - Return an empty string if no pre-aggregation filter is needed.

6. Post-Aggregation Filter:
   - A filter applied to the aggregated results (comparable to a HAVING clause).
   - Use valid DuckDB SQL syntax.
   - Return an empty string if no post-aggregation filter is needed.

────────────────────────────
V. OUTPUT FORMAT

Your output must be valid JSON in the following structure:

{
    "dimensions": ["<dimension1>", "<dimension2>", ...],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "<measure1>", "alias": "<alias1>" },
        { "expression": "<measure2>", "alias": "<alias2>" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "<some_pre_aggregation_filter>",
    "post_aggregation_filters": "<some_post_aggregation_filter>"
}

Ensure all JSON is valid. If you cannot fully customize the query, return an empty object.

────────────────────────────
VI. EXAMPLES

Example 1:
User Query: Show me how many service requests were created each month.
Expected Output:
{
    "dimensions": ["created_date"],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "count(1)", "alias": "num_of_requests" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "",
    "post_aggregation_filters": ""
}

Example 2:
User Query: List the street name, borough, and status for all open requests in Brooklyn.
Expected Output:
{
    "dimensions": ["street_name", "borough", "status"],
    "measures": [],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "borough = 'BROOKLYN' AND status = 'Open'",
    "post_aggregation_filters": ""
}

Example 3:
User Query: Show me the count of requests by neighborhood.
Expected Output:
{
    "dimensions": ["neighborhood"],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "count(1)", "alias": "num_of_requests" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "",
    "post_aggregation_filters": ""
}
