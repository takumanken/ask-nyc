────────────────────────────
IV. DEFINITIONS FOR SQL GENERATION

1. Time Dimension:
   - One column representing time (date format).
   - If multiple are available, select the best for trend analysis.
   - Return an empty list if none exists.

2. Categorical Dimension:
   - All non-time columns.
   - Treat columns, e.g., created_year_datepart & closed_month_datepart, as categorical.
   - Return an empty list if none exists.

3. Measure:
   - A column or expression for aggregate calculations.
   - Use DuckDB SQL dialect. Provide aliases as specified.
   - Return an empty list if none exists.

4. Pre-Aggregation Filter:
   - A filter applied before aggregation (like a WHERE clause).
   - Use DuckDB SQL syntax.
   - Return an empty string if no filter is required.

5. Post-Aggregation Filter:
   - A filter applied after aggregation (like a HAVING clause).
   - Use DuckDB SQL syntax.
   - Return an empty string if no filter is required.

────────────────────────────
V. OUTPUT FORMAT

Your output must be valid JSON in the following structure:

{
    "time_dimension": ["<time_dimension1>"],
    "categorical_dimension": ["<categorical_dimension1>", "<categorical_dimension2>"],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "<measure1>", "alias": "<alias1>" },
        { "expression": "<measure2>", "alias": "<alias2>" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "<some_pre_aggregation_filter>",
    "post_aggregation_filters": "<some_post_aggregation_filter>"
}

Ensure all JSON is valid. If you cannot fully customize the query, return an empty object.

────────────────────────────
VI. EXAMPLES

Example 1:
User Query: Show me how many service requests were created each month.
Expected Output:
{
    "time_dimension": ["created_date"],
    "categorical_dimension": [],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "count(1)", "alias": "num_of_requests" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "",
    "post_aggregation_filters": ""
}

Example 2:
User Query: List the street name, borough, and status for all open requests in Brooklyn.
Expected Output:
{
    "time_dimension": [],
    "categorical_dimension": ["street_name", "borough", "status"],
    "measures": [],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "borough = 'BROOKLYN' AND status = 'Open'",
    "post_aggregation_filters": ""
}

Example 3:
User Query: Show me only the boroughs that have at least 1,000 'Noise - Street/Sidewalk' complaints.
Expected Output:
{
    "time_dimension": [],
    "categorical_dimension": ["borough"],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "count(1)", "alias": "num_of_requests" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "complaint_category = 'Community Noise'",
    "post_aggregation_filters": "count(1) >= 1000"
}
