# DEFINITIONS

Time Dimension:
  - A column representing time stored in a date format.
  - Only a single time dimension should be returned. If multiple candidates exist, choose the one best suited for trend analysis.
  - Return an empty list if there is no time dimension.

Categorical Dimension:
  - All columns not included in the Time Dimension.
  - Although some columns (e.g., created_year_datepart, closed_month_datepart) contain temporal information, treat them as categorical since they are not continuous.
  - Return an empty list if there is no categorical dimension.

Measure:
  - A column or expression used for aggregated calculations.
  - Use DuckDB SQL dialect.
  - Provide an alias as shown above.
  - Return an empty list if there is no measure.

Pre-Aggregation Filter:
  - A filter applied before aggregation (similar to a WHERE clause in SQL).
  - Use DuckDB SQL dialect.
  - Return an empty string if no filter is required.

Post-Aggregation Filter:
  - A filter applied after aggregation (similar to a HAVING clause in SQL).
  - Use DuckDB SQL dialect.
  - Return an empty string if no filter is required.

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Return your output in valid JSON format, following this structure:

{
    "time_dimension": ["<time_dimension1>"],
    "categorical_dimension": ["<categorical_dimension1>", "<categorical_dimension2>"],
    "measures": [
        { "expression": "<measure1>", "alias": "<alias1>" },
        { "expression": "<measure2>", "alias": "<alias2>" }
    ],
    "pre_aggregation_filters": "<some_pre_aggregation_filter>",
    "post_aggregation_filters": "<some_post_aggregation_filter>"
}

- Ensure your JSON is valid and accurately reflects the user’s request.
- If you cannot fully address the request, return an empty object.
