# Project Title
Building a Trusted Conversational Analytics System: Natural Language Interfaces for Effective Data Visualization and Exploration

# Abstract
Utilizing advanced NLP, database querying, and automated chart selection, this project investigates how to design, implement, and evaluate a conversational analytics system. By blending user-centered design with robust architecture, it aims to create an accessible, trustworthy environment for exploring and visualizing data using natural language interactions.
