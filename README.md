Upon landing on ASK NYC, you‚Äôll encounter a clean, search-engine‚Äìstyle interface featuring:

| Element                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search bar**                    | Type a plain-English question about the NYC 311 dataset (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat are the most common complaint types in Brooklyn?‚Äù) and press Enter.|
| **‚ÄúWhat can you answer?‚Äù button** | Displays a sample query explaining how to use the system.|
| **‚ÄúSurprise Me!‚Äù button**         | Autofills the search bar with a random example to encourage exploration, even if you're unfamiliar with the dataset‚Äôs structure. |

## Privacy Notice

By using ASK NYC you agree that:

- **Query Processing**: All queries entered are processed through Google's Gemini API to create data visualizations. Because this site uses the free Gemini tier, Google may retain prompts and outputs to improve its services. See [Google's AI terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms) for more details.

- **Location Data**: If you enable "Use my NYC location," your coarse latitude/longitude (3-decimal places, approximately 111m accuracy) will be sent to our servers. This information is used solely to retrieve relevant local data.

- **Connection Logs**: GitHub Pages (site host) and Railway (API host) automatically log connection metadata such as IP addresses for security purposes. For details, see [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#data-collection) and [Railway's privacy policy](https://railway.com/legal/privacy).

- **Internal Logs**: We maintain brief internal diagnostics logs (timestamp + query/result) purely for troubleshooting purposes. These logs auto-delete on routine rotation and are never shared with third parties.

Please refrain from submitting sensitive or personally identifiable information through your queries.
